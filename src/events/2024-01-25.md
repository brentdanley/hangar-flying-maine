**Where** üó∫Ô∏è Novare Res Bier Cafe

Hey fellow aviators! Ready for another round of hangar talk? Join us on January 25th at Novare Res for an evening of laid-back conversations and great beers. Kicking off at 6 PM, we'll be swapping stories, discussing the joys and challenges of flying in Maine, and simply enjoying the company of those who share a passion for the skies.

No formalities, no guest speakers‚Äîjust good old hangar flying. Whether you're a seasoned pilot or just love the idea of flying, come share your experiences, learn a bit from others, and enjoy the camaraderie of fellow flight enthusiasts.

Novare Res offers the perfect setting with its excellent selection of ales and a chill vibe. It's all about relaxing, sharing our flying adventures, and maybe debating the merits of various avionics or the best routes to navigate around Casco Bay.

No need to RSVP‚Äîjust turn up if you're interested. Looking forward to seeing old faces and welcoming new ones into our flying community. Let‚Äôs make it a night of good stories and great company!
