A heartfelt thank you to everyone who joined us for January's hangar flying session. It was fantastic to see so many familiar faces.

A special shout-out to Patrick, who not only is new to our hangar flying gatherings but also recently celebrated earning his commercial pilot certificate. Patrick's achievement is a huge milestone, and his insights added great value to our discussions. Your participation and achievements truly enrich our community.

Looking ahead, we're excited to invite all aviators to our February event on the 22nd at Novare Res. This gathering promises to be another excellent opportunity for sharing stories, tips, and camaraderie. Whether you're a seasoned pilot or just starting, your presence makes these events special. Let's come together to celebrate our passion for aviation, share our experiences, and enjoy some good company. Mark your calendars â€“ we can't wait to see you there!

### S.2675 - Backcountry Aviation Protection Act

General Aviation needs your help!

Please contact Maine's Congressional representatives to express your support of [Senate Bill 2675](https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/2675/text?s=1&r=52), also known as the **"Backcountry Aviation Protection Act."** This bill proposes significant changes to the FAA's minimum altitude regulations, especially for backcountry flying. It's a game-changer for pilots who often engage in go-arounds, inspection passes, and practice approaches, particularly in challenging terrains where adhering to the standard minimum altitudes can be impractical.

The bill aims to give pilots more flexibility and judgment in executing these maneuvers, enhancing both safety and training quality. It's a step towards acknowledging the unique demands of backcountry aviation and tailoring regulations to better fit real-world scenarios. This bill, if passed, could make a big difference in our flying routines, especially for those who love to push the boundaries over Maine's diverse landscapes.

### ForeFlight's New Voyager App

If you're the owner of a new Apple Vision Pro, be sure to check out [ForeFlight Voyager](https://foreflight.com/products/voyager/) for aviation enthusiasts. I've been fortunate to follow its development--from a distance--and am looking forward to seeing it in the device soon.

See you in a few weeks!
