Hangar Flying on First Thursdays started in December of 2006 as a planning meeting for the Bald Eagle Flying Club. Then president Dennis Melton felt that the club’s monthly meetings didn’t leave enough casual time to chat and think about long-term goals for the club. He felt a venue with food and drink would be the right setting, so a group of members got together in the basement restaurant of Sebago Brewing, then located on Middle Street in Portland’s Old Port.

It went well, so Dennis sent out an email in early January of 2007 saying, “Holidays are still wearing off us... But I wanted to see if we had interest in getting together again at the Sebago Brewing Co as we did last month. Who is in?”

By February it was officially “Hangar Flying” with discussing club business now second to just discussing anything aviation. By April, club members were encouraged to bring anyone interested in flying. By August, Jeff Van West took over the promotion and email list. It was called the monthly get together of the Portland Pilot’s Club for a while, but everyone called in “Hangar Flying” so the name reverted and stuck.

Jeff kept it going on the first Thursday of the month for the next six years with a regular attendance of 8-20 pilots at the Sebago location on Middle street and on Franklin Street after the pub moved.

In November of 2013, Annie Beaulieu came to a Hangar Flying night ... and the group was never the same. She spread the word across more of Maine and invited controllers over the radio as she participated in many, many compassion flight missions. She rebranded it has Portland Pilot Burger Night (although Hangar Flying was still used as well) and even got a discount rate at the Hampton so visiting pilots could stay overnight if they wanted a beer. Annie and Jeff both sent out monthly reminders. Participation was varied from lows of 8-10 people to nights when almost 50 pilots, controllers, and other aviation enthusiasts were in attendance. Sebago waitstaff apparently looked forward to the group each month, requesting to be on the email reminder as well.

Covid finally shut it down. It’s been dormant since.
