Greetings Fellow Aviators!

_This gathering will generally be on the fourth Thursday, but since you'll likely be watching football and spending time with family next week, I've pushed it to the fifth Thursday this month._

After a brief hiatus, I'm thrilled to announce that our beloved Hangar Flying gathering is back on! We're set to meet at Novare Res on November 30th, from 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM. It's going to be a casual and relaxed evening where we can all kick back, enjoy some great beer, talk flying, and indulge in delicious food.

This is the perfect opportunity to share stories from the sky, discuss our flying adventures, or just enjoy the camaraderie of fellow aviation enthusiasts. Whether you're a seasoned pilot, controller, right-seater, student, or just have a passion for aviation, you're welcome to join us.

No formal agenda, just good times and great company. Let's make this a night to remember! Looking forward to seeing old friends and meeting new ones in the flying community.

Fly safe and see you there!
