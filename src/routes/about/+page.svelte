<h1>Welcome to Hangar Flying Maine!</h1>

<h4>What It Is:</h4>
<p>
	Ever wished for a casual, no-strings-attached gathering where aviation enthusiasts can just...
	talk planes? That's exactly what our monthly Hangar Flying Maine is all about! Held on the fourth
	Thursday of each month, this is a space where the only thing on the agenda is our shared passion
	for flying.
</p>

<h4>Why It Matters:</h4>
<p>
	In a world where everything seems structured and meetings are often boxed into agendas, we yearned
	for something different – a chance to connect with fellow aviators and enthusiasts in an informal
	setting. Whether you're a seasoned pilot, a newbie eager to learn, someone interested in setting
	up a flight simulator at home, or just curious about the world of aviation, this meetup is for
	you.
</p>

<h4>No Agenda, Just Passion:</h4>
<p>
	We firmly believe that the best conversations happen spontaneously. That's why our meetups have no
	speakers, no formal presentations, and absolutely no sales pitches. It's just a bunch of flying
	buffs hanging out, sharing stories, tips, and perhaps a laugh or two.
</p>

<h4>Find a Mentor, Be a Mentor:</h4>
<p>
	Looking for an instructor? Excited about a new piece of sim kit you recently acquired? Want to
	understand the ins and outs of ForeFlight? Interested in joining a flying club? Or maybe you have
	wisdom to share about your own aviation journey. This meetup is the perfect place to exchange
	knowledge, experiences, and perhaps make lifelong connections in the aviation community.
</p>

<h4>Join Us:</h4>

	Come as you are, grab a beer, and dive into the world of aviation with us. It's casual, it's fun,

<h4>Our History</h4>
<p>
	Hangar Flying on First Thursdays started in December of 2006 as a planning meeting for the Bald
	Eagle Flying Club. Then president Dennis Melton felt that the club’s monthly meetings didn’t leave
	enough casual time to chat and think about long-term goals for the club. He felt a venue with food
	and drink would be the right setting, so a group of members got together in the basement
	restaurant of Sebago Brewing, then located on Middle Street in Portland’s Old Port.
</p>

<p>
	It went well, so Dennis sent out an email in early January of 2007 saying, “Holidays are still
	wearing off us... But I wanted to see if we had interest in getting together again at the Sebago
	Brewing Co as we did last month. Who is in?”
</p>

<p>
	By February it was officially “Hangar Flying” with discussing club business now second to just
	discussing anything aviation. By April, club members were encouraged to bring anyone interested in
	flying. By August, Jeff Van West took over the promotion and email list. It was called the monthly
	get together of the Portland Pilot’s Club for a while, but everyone called in “Hangar Flying” so
	the name reverted and stuck.
</p>

<p>
	Jeff kept it going on the first Thursday of the month for the next six years with a regular
	attendance of 8-20 pilots at the Sebago location on Middle street and on Franklin Street after the
	pub moved.
</p>

<p>
	In November of 2013, Annie Beaulieu came to a Hangar Flying night ... and the group was never the
	same. She spread the word across more of Maine and invited controllers over the radio as she
	participated in many, many compassion flight missions. She rebranded it has Portland Pilot Burger
	Night (although Hangar Flying was still used as well) and even got a discount rate at the Hampton
	so visiting pilots could stay overnight if they wanted a beer. Annie and Jeff both sent out
	monthly reminders. Participation was varied from lows of 8-10 people to nights when almost 50
	pilots, controllers, and other aviation enthusiasts were in attendance. Sebago waitstaff
	apparently looked forward to the group each month, requesting to be on the email reminder as well.

<h4>Who is Brent?</h4>
<p>
	Meet Brent, the heart and soul behind Hangar Flying Maine. Brent's journey in the sky began in
	1998 when he earned his private pilot certificate, sparking a lifelong passion for aviation.
</p>
<p>
	Brent proudly served in the United States Air Force, where for 11 years he honed his expertise in
	avionics maintenance, specializing in the KC-135 Stratotanker, a modified Boeing 707.
</p>
<p>
	Brent's aviation journey didn't stop there. He further expanded his skills at Bombardier
	Aerospace, working as an electrician on both narrow- and wide-body business jets, blending his
	technical prowess with his love for aviation.
</p>
<p>
	Today, Brent combines his deep-rooted aviation knowledge with his technical acumen as a software
	engineer at ForeFlight, where he's responsible for developing the web map – a tool countless
	pilots rely on.
</p>
<p>
	But Brent's not just about high altitudes and technical details. He's also an adventurer at heart.
	Each year, Brent heads to Alaska, embracing the thrill of flying low over glaciers and landing on
	water, an experience that continues to fuel his passion for aviation.
</p>
<p>
	With such a rich background in both the practical and technical sides of flying, Brent is more
	than just an organizer – he's a mentor, a guide, and a friend to anyone who shares his passion for
	the skies.
